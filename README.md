# Fantasy Football Draft Board üèà

A real-time multi-user fantasy football draft application built with WebSockets and Node.js.

## Team Members
- Allen Stevens

## App Description

This application allows 4 users to participate in a live fantasy football draft where they can:
- Join with custom team names and get randomly assigned draft positions
- Draft players in turn-based order with real-time validation
- See players automatically placed in correct roster positions (QB, RB1, RB2, WR1, WR2, TE)
- Watch all updates happen instantly across all connected browsers

The app currently includes **36 hardcoded NFL players** (6 QBs, 12 RBs, 12 WRs, 6 TEs) providing enough variety for strategic drafting. For expanded player pools, a CSV file with additional players can be uploaded instead.

## Justification for Using WebSockets

WebSockets are essential because when one user drafts a player, all other users must see the update immediately. Traditional HTTP requests would require constant polling and wouldn't provide the seamless real-time experience that makes fantasy drafts engaging.
